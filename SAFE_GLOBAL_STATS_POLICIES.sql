-- üõ°Ô∏è SAFE GLOBAL STATS POLICY FIX - PRESERVES YOUR ECHO COUNT
-- This will ONLY fix missing policies, NEVER touches the echo count value

-- ‚ö†Ô∏è GUARANTEED: This script will NOT modify your echo count!

-- Step 1: Check your current echo count (READ ONLY)
SELECT 'üîç CURRENT ECHO COUNT (unchanged):' as message, total_echoes, updated_at 
FROM global_stats WHERE id = 1;

-- Step 2: Check existing policies
SELECT 'Current policies:' as info, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'global_stats';

-- Step 3: Create missing policies ONLY (without touching data)
-- These are needed for the app to work, but don't affect existing data

-- Read policy
