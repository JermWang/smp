# 🎨 **Green Eyes Generator - NFT & Cartoon Support**

## ✅ **Now Optimized for Crypto Twitter!**

Your Green Eyes generator has been completely upgraded to handle the diverse artwork styles popular on crypto Twitter and Web3 communities.

## 🖼️ **Supported Artwork Types**

### **🔥 Primary Support (Works Great)**
- **NFT Collections**: BAYC, CryptoPunks, Pudgy Penguins, Doodles, Azuki
- **Anime Characters**: Any anime or manga-style artwork
- **Cartoon Characters**: Disney, cartoon animals, stylized characters
- **Digital Art**: Hand-drawn, painted, or digitally created characters
- **3D Renders**: Blender, Maya, or other 3D character models
- **Pixel Art**: 8-bit, 16-bit, or modern pixel characters

### **✅ Also Works Well**
- **Realistic Photos**: Human faces and portraits
- **Animal Characters**: Cats, dogs, apes, penguins, any creatures with eyes
- **Robot/Cyborg Characters**: Mechanical beings with visible eyes
- **Abstract Art**: Stylized faces with recognizable eye features
- **Profile Pictures**: Any PFP with distinguishable eyes

### **⚠️ Challenging (But Will Try)**
- **Very Abstract Art**: Minimal eye features
- **Side Profiles**: Eyes not clearly visible
- **Heavily Stylized**: Extremely distorted or geometric eyes
- **Multiple Characters**: Images with many faces (focuses on main character)

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Smart Prompt System**
The generator now uses **3 different AI strategies**:

1. **Primary**: NFT-optimized prompt mentioning specific collections and art styles
2. **Fallback**: Simpler approach for tricky artwork
3. **Simple**: Basic laser eyes for challenging cases

### **Auto-Detection**
- Recognizes humans, cartoons, animals, robots, aliens
- Works with any eye shape: round, almond, geometric, stylized
- Adapts to different art styles automatically

## 🎯 **Best Results Tips**

### **For NFT Collections:**
- **Bored Apes**: Eyes are clearly visible, works perfectly
- **CryptoPunks**: Pixel eyes detected reliably
- **Pudgy Penguins**: Animal eyes work great
- **Anime NFTs**: Highly compatible with large anime eyes

### **For Cartoon Characters:**
- **Clear eye visibility**: Eyes should be the main facial feature
- **Good contrast**: Eyes stand out from background/face
- **Front-facing preferred**: Profile views work but front is better

### **For Abstract/Artistic:**
- **Some eye indication**: Even stylized dots or shapes work
- **Character focus**: Single character works better than groups
- **Clear resolution**: Higher quality gives better results

## 🧪 **Testing Your Artwork**
