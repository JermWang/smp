# 🖼️ Green Eyes Image Loading Test Guide

## Updated Features

I've added comprehensive debugging and fixes to the Green Eyes generator:

### ✅ **Fixes Applied**

1. **Memory Leak Prevention**
   - Added proper `URL.revokeObjectURL()` cleanup
   - Cleanup on component unmount
   - Cleanup when selecting new images
   - Cleanup when resetting modal

2. **Enhanced Debugging**
   - Console logs for file selection
   - Console logs for image loading success/failure
   - Debug state indicator in modal header
   - Detailed error reporting

3. **Fallback Image Loading**
   - Uses Next.js Image component first
   - Falls back to regular `<img>` tag if Next.js fails
   - Better error handling for both methods

4. **Improved State Management**
   - Reset image error state on new uploads
   - Proper state cleanup in all scenarios

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### 1. Open Developer Console
- Press F12 in your browser
- Go to Console tab
- Watch for debug messages

### 2. Test Image Upload
1. **Click Green Eyes button** (bottom left of main app)
2. **Upload a test image** (try a small PNG or JPG)
3. **Watch console output** - you should see:
   ```
   📁 File selected: {name: "test.png", size: 12345, type: "image/png"}
   🔗 Created preview URL: blob:http://localhost:3000/...
   ✅ Preview image loaded successfully
   ```

### 3. Check Debug State
- Look at the top of the modal
- You should see: `Stage: upload | Image: ✓ | Preview: ✓`
- If Preview shows ✗, there's a URL creation issue
- If Image shows ✗, the file selection failed

### 4. Test Different Image Types
Try these to isolate issues:
- **Small PNG** (like a screenshot) - should work best
- **Small JPG** (under 1MB) - should work well
- **Large image** (2-5MB) - should work but slower
- **Invalid file** (like a .txt file) - should show error

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- `✅ Preview image loaded successfully` in console
- Image appears in the upload area
- Debug state shows all checkmarks
- No error messages

### ❌ **Failure Indicators**
- `❌ Preview image failed to load` in console
- Empty or broken image in upload area
- Debug state shows ✗ for Preview
- Error messages about blob URLs

### 🛠️ **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### Issue: "Preview image failed to load"
**Solution**: Check if:
- File is valid JPG/PNG
- File size under 5MB
- Browser supports blob URLs (should be universal)

#### Issue: Images show briefly then disappear
**Solution**: This was the memory leak - should be fixed now

#### Issue: Debug state shows Image: ✗
**Solution**: File selection failed - check file type validation

#### Issue: Console shows URL revocation errors
**Solution**: This is normal cleanup - ignore these

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

If images are loading correctly now:
1. **Try the full generator flow** (upload → process → download)
2. **Test with your actual profile picture**
3. **Remove debug logs** when ready for production

If still having issues:
1. **Copy exact console error messages**
2. **Note which step fails** (upload, display, or processing)
3. **Try different browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. **Try incognito mode** to rule out cache issues

## 🔧 **Debug Commands**

Run these in browser console to test:

```javascript
// Test blob URL creation
const testBlob = new Blob(['test'], {type: 'text/plain'});
const testUrl = URL.createObjectURL(testBlob);
console.log('Test URL:', testUrl);

// Test file input
document.querySelector('input[type="file"]')?.click();

// Check current state (when modal is open)
console.log('Modal state available for inspection');
```

The image loading should be much more reliable now! 🎉
